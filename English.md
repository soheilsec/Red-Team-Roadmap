## 1. What is Red Teaming?

<div  align="justify">From a historical perspective, red teaming originated from exercises conducted by the US military during the Cold War, with the Soviet Army representing the Red Team and the US Army representing the Blue Team. However, in the realm of cybersecurity, red teaming refers to simulating hostile or adversarial attacks. Generally, if you aim to work as a red teamer, you'll be assigned various tasks depending on the job role, requiring skills across different domains. For example: Finding and enhancing the execution chain of malware for Blue Team evaluation,
such as the following chain: URL > ZIP > JS > cURL > .dll Discovering new and diverse methods to bypass security mechanisms nlike application whitelisting, UAC bypass, AV evasion, EDR evasion, etc.</div>

<a id="item-II"></a>
## 2. What Red Teaming is Not?
Penetration testing itself is not red teaming; rather, it's one of the penetration techniques, such as web hacking.

<a id="item-III"></a>
## 3. Where is Red Teaming Used?

Offensive Security Maturity Model

![readteam00013](https://github.com/soheilsec/Red-Team-Roadmap/assets/46918547/f2050f1d-40f7-4724-9c15-30fc823bef83  "Cymulate offensive security matuirty model")
  
<div  align="justify">Organizations have various levels of offensive security maturity. Vulnerability scanning and vulnerability assessment are performed across all organizations. Depending on the size of the organizations, they either have an in-house penetration testing department, outsource this function, or even utilize bug bounty programs. Organizations with blue teams use internal or external red teaming to assess team performance and discover security gaps. Purple team exercises serve as a method to establish balance and aid in increasing the efficiency of red and blue teams to achieve higher detection rates and reduce false positives. Simulating APT groups to assess the performance of defensive teams is highly practical.</div>
  
<a id="item-IV"></a>
## 4. Steps for an Internal Red Team in an Organization:

• Understanding the network, security equipment, and the presence or absence of sensors. 
• Preparing tests according to the network and security equipment and implementing them. 
• Discovering security gaps and reporting them to the blue team. 
• Reviewing and re-executing tests to ensure that the gaps have been addressed. 
• At an advanced level of blue team maturity, simulation of techniques or APT group activities should be conducted by the red team. If an organization has reached maturity and has had at least 4 years of blue teaming, tests should be implemented at a higher level, focusing more on bypassing and observing detection and non-detection by the blue team. Additionally, malware development is one of the most important tasks.

## 11. Two open-source tools that are very useful for simulating tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the context of MITRE ATT&CK are:

Atomic Red Team: A library of simple, automatable tests that exercise the ATT&CK matrix. These tests are designed to validate detection capabilities of security solutions. Atomic Red Team tests can be executed with minimal dependencies and are compatible with most platforms. 
Caldera: An automated adversary emulation system that performs post-compromise adversarial behavior within a Windows enterprise network. It generates an intrusion kill chain and produces artifacts that allow defenders to evaluate their security operations' capabilities to detect, respond to, and remediate the actions of an adversary. \

[C2 Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b4mUxa6cDQuTV2BPC6aA-GR4zGZi0ooPYtBe4IgPsSc/edit?pli=1#gid=0)

<a id="item-XII"></a>
## 12.Does the MITRE ATT&CK framework provide complete coverage?

Generally, the MITRE ATT&CK framework is a community-driven security framework where many security companies report new techniques over time, and the MITRE team adds them after review. However, this process is time-consuming, and MITRE is not updated in real-time. Sources for updates include threat intelligence reports, security researcher articles, post-incident reports released after organizational hacks, blogs, and security researcher tweets, which can serve as sources to expand the coverage breadth of TTPs.
